# web-scraping-challenge

This assignment consists of two technical products. The analyst submitted the following deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
- Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Steps Deliverable 1 : Scrape Titles and Preview Text fro Mars News
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site Links to an external site. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
- Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
- Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that has been scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
  - Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview.
  - Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
  - Print the list in jupyter notebook.

Steps Deliverable 2 : Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site Links to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. Note that the URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.
- Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. Note that this can also be achieved by using the Pandas read_html function.
- Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings:
id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
    - terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
    - sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
    - ls: the solar longitude
    - month: the Martian month
    - min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
    - pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location
- Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.
- Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
    - How many months exist on Mars?
    - How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    - What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
        - Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
        - Plot the results as a bar chart.
    - Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
        - Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
        - Plot the results as a bar chart.
    - About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
        - Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
        - Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature of each observation.
- Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
